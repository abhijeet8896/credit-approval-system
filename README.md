Credit Approval SystemProject OverviewThe Credit Approval System is a robust backend platform designed to automate the process of evaluating customer creditworthiness. Built with Django and Django Rest Framework, the system analyzes historical financial behavior to determine loan eligibility, manage credit limits, and process loan applications.The architecture is designed for scalability and reliability, utilizing asynchronous background processing for data ingestion and a fully containerized environment for consistent deployment.Core Functionality1. Customer ManagementNew users are registered with an automated credit limit assignment. The system calculates an approved_limit by rounding 36 times the user's monthly salary to the nearest lakh, establishing a baseline for risk management.2. Credit Scoring EngineThe system calculates a credit score (0–100) by evaluating several key metrics:Historical Consistency: Analysis of past EMIs paid on time.Loan Volume: The total number of loans previously taken by the user.Recency: Credit activity within the current calendar year.Debt-to-Limit Ratio: If current debt exceeds the approved limit, the score is automatically set to 0.3. Loan Eligibility LogicEligibility is determined by a combination of the calculated credit score and the user's "EMI Burden." If the total monthly EMI obligations exceed 50% of the customer's monthly salary, all new loan applications are rejected.The system applies interest rate adjustments based on the following slabs:Credit ScoreApproval StatusInterest Rate Correction> 50ApprovedAs requested30 – 50ApprovedMinimum 12%10 – 30ApprovedMinimum 16%< 10RejectedN/ATechnical StackFramework: Django 5+, Django Rest FrameworkDatabase: PostgreSQLTask Queue: Celery + Redis (for background data processing)Data Handling: Pandas (Excel parsing and ingestion)Infrastructure: Docker & Docker ComposeProject StructurePlaintextcredit_system/

API DocumentationCustomer RegistrationPOST /registerCreates a new customer profile and returns the calculated credit limit.Eligibility CheckPOST /check-eligibilityA "dry-run" endpoint that evaluates if a customer qualifies for a specific loan without persisting the record to the database. It returns the approval status and the adjusted interest rate.Loan CreationPOST /create-loanFinalizes a loan application. It validates eligibility one final time, creates the loan record, and updates the customer's total debt balance.Loan RetrievalGET /view-loan/<loan_id>: Returns comprehensive details of a specific loan, including associated customer data.GET /view-loans/<customer_id>: Returns a list of all active loans for a specific customer, detailing the remaining balance for each.Data Ingestion & Background TasksTo handle large datasets without blocking the main application thread, the system uses Celery workers to ingest historical data from customer_data.xlsx and loan_data.xlsx. This ensures that the system is ready for use immediately while data continues to populate in the background.Getting StartedPrerequisitesDockerDocker ComposeInstallation and DeploymentThe entire stack, including the web server, database, Redis broker, and Celery workers, can be launched with a single command:Bashdocker-compose up --build
Once the containers are healthy, the API will be accessible at localhost:8000.Development NotesService Layer Architecture: Business logic is decoupled from views to ensure the codebase remains maintainable and testable.Data Integrity: The system uses PostgreSQL transactions to ensure that customer debt updates and loan creations occur atomically.
